        Hello, I have some hobbies in my life.
      </p>
      <p className="hobbies-paragraph">
        For example, I like to do sport in a Gym. I’m doing it from 2002. I have
        a bench press and dumbbells, barbells at home. I do sport at home, in
        the Gym and at workout place in the park. I lead a healthy lifestyle. I
        graduated from Gym Instructor courses in 2021 for myself.
      </p>
      <p className="hobbies-paragraph">
        Also I’m interested in computer’s hardware and software (such as some
        programs and computer games). Sometimes I like to build a computer or to
        play computer games different genres.
