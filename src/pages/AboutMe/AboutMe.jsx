      <h1>About Me:</h1>
      <p className="about-paragraph">Hello, let me introduce myself.</p>
      <p className="about-paragraph">
        I am a responsible person who is attentive to details and have some
        creativity.
      </p>
      <p className="about-paragraph">
        I chose Front-end, because I like to work with a visual interface and a
        program/style code, not only with a program code. I made a website in
        2006-2008 about a gym. This site used only HTML and some JavaScript
        features.
      </p>
      <p className="about-paragraph">
        I have five with half months of non-commercial experience in Front-end
        Development while I studied at SKILLUP courses. Also I got acquainted
        with some Back-end basics while I did my course project, such as
        Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Socket.io. I have some Front-end projects
        and one full stack (MERN) course project that deployed on the GitHub and
        the Heroku hosting, you can familiarize yourself with them.
